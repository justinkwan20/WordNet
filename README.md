# WordNet
Word Net is a project that I have worked on at University Of Massachusetts Boston. WordNet is a project on finding words and corresponding
synonmyns for those words. In this project I used graphs and how they can be used to find synonmys for those words and if words appear
more than once then it would only accept unquiue values.
